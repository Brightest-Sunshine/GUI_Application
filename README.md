The second laboratory work in a cycle on the subject of User Interface Development
# GUI_Application
This is a student project in which it is necessary to implement
one-dimensional optimization methods into GUI
Programming language is Python 3.7

## Installing dependencies

To connect all the dependencies, you need to write in the terminal
```python
   pip install -r requirement.txt
```
***

## Running application  
To start program write to console from project root
```commandline
   python -m app.main
```
***
After running this command you will see Main Window of our Application  
![PIC_1](https://github.com/Brightest-Sunshine/pictures-for-README-files/blob/master/pics/Pic1.png) 

Here you can write yours one-dimensional function, what you need to optimize  
Because we use in expression recognition sympy, you should write you function in his syntax for your function.  

![PIC_2](https://github.com/Brightest-Sunshine/pictures-for-README-files/blob/master/pics/Pic2.png)   

After What you can choose left and right border of exploring interval and needed precession  
![PIC_3](https://github.com/Brightest-Sunshine/pictures-for-README-files/blob/master/pics/Pic3.png)  

After What you can choose parameters you want to be applied to you function during this run.
![PIC_4](https://github.com/Brightest-Sunshine/pictures-for-README-files/blob/master/pics/Pic4.png)  

Now you just need to click solve, and you would get your result
